# Guppy-Dashboard

If you use Profit Trailer and want better reporting, then take a look at the tools I've developed here. You'll need the following prerequisites:

- mySQL
- Grafana (either self-host or use their free/paid hosting)
- PHP 7.x

Installation instructions are in the <a href="https://github.com/geeklingo/Guppy-Dashboard/wiki">wiki</a>.

If you find this dashboard useful, feel free to shout me a coffee for all the late nights that went into this:

Note #1: This initial version is structured to support a single PT bot instance, not multiple.
Note #2: The Guppy Dashboard does not require api access to the exchanges. It retrieves data that is stored in the Profit Trailer log file. As such, what it can report on is constrained to what's in the PT log.
Note #3: The Guppy Dashboard is an externally developed dashboard with no association with the Profit Trailer team. As such, it is neither supported or endorsed by them. Any support requests can be submitted on GitHub.
